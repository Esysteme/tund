Tund (tunneling daemon) establishes a reverse SSH tunnel from some publically
accessible computer to your own. In the event of theft, loss, or NAT, you can
easily access your machine.

You need two computers: the local host (say, your laptop), and the remote host,
which is publically accessible. Tund will use SSH forwarding to connect a
certain port on the remote host to a certain port on the local host. You can then ssh -p some-port remote.com to access your local host.

Install tund and generate a keypair. I've included an upstart setup script.
local$ sudo bin/setup

Create a user on the remote host
remote$ adduser --disabled-password --shell /bin/false tunnel
remote$ cd ~tunnel
remote$ rm -rf .bash* .profile

On the tunneling host, create .ssh/authorized_keys
remote$ mkdir .ssh
remote$ $VISUAL .ssh/authorized_keys

and paste the public key into that file.

Seal the user's homedir
remote$ chmod 400 .ssh/authorized_keys
remote$ chmod 500 . .ssh

Confirm that you can establish a tunnel:
local$ ssh -vgN -i etc/key -R 2222:localhost:22 tunnel@remote.com

And finally, configure the options in bin/tund. An upstart script is located in etc/tund.conf for your convenience; simply run bin/setup for automatic startup.
